### TODO

- [ ] Learn about json.dump() json.dumps() json.load() json.loads()


### Known Issues

* Should I store JSON in a fil, or should we fetch the data on the fly?

* Valid JSON not getting written into file, currently using hacks by explicitly writing `[`, `]` and truncating a comma at last.

* If length of movie title is > 10 then table gets fucked up.

* Runtime column not getting sorted (just considers the first number for sorting)

* What about movies that gets guessed incorrectly, eg Oceans Eleven resulting in response="False"
