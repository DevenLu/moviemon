### Stretch Goals

* Use MongoDB to store data instead of storing json data in file.
* Run a cron job to detect if the directory containg movies has been modified, if it has been modified then reindex the directory for accomdating new or deleted movies.
* As mentioned by [@dufferzafar](https://github.com/dufferzafar) this can seriously become a movie database 'tagger' like [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).
