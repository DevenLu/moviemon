# moviemon

**A Python Application that displays all the information about all your movies in the command line.**

**WARNING; It seems like the auther of moviemon doesn't really update the code very often so this repo will be updated by me more often to eliminate bugs and to add features. Thanks to the ICHAIT for base of this program!**

### Stretch Goals

* Use MongoDB to store data instead of storing json data in file.
* Run a cron job to detect if the directory containing movies has been modified, if it has been modified then reindex the directory for accommodating new or deleted movies.
* As mentioned by [@dufferzafar](https://github.com/dufferzafar) this can seriously become a movie database 'tagger' like [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).
